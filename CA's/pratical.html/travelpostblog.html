    <h3><li>little intro about Banarsh and my first experience:</li></h3>
    <p>Banaras, one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities, is a treasure trove of spirituality, 
      culture, and history. As I stepped into this ancient city, I was immediately struck by its vibrant energy
       and timeless charm. My first experience in Banaras was a mesmerizing sunset boat ride along the Ganges River,
        watching the city come alive with twinkling diyas and chanting sadhus. As the boat glided past the ghats, 
        I felt the cool river breeze carry the whispers of the past, while the setting sun painted the sky with
         hues of crimson and gold. The sweet scent of incense and fresh flowers filled the air, drawing me into the 
         city's mystical embrace. It was a truly surreal experience, and I knew in that moment, Banaras had already
          left an indelible mark on my heart</p>

      <h3><li>how i feel after go there:</li></h3>
    <p>As I immersed myself in Banaras' spiritual and cultural landscape, I felt a profound shift in my 
      perspective. The city's ancient wisdom, vibrant energy, and warm hospitality awakened a sense of inner peace
       and connection to the world around me. I began to see life as a beautiful tapestry of moments, each one an opportunity to grow, learn, and love. The city's embrace of contradictions - old and new, chaos and serenity - taught me to appreciate the beauty of complexity and the value of balance. As I left Banaras, I felt refreshed, renewed, and inspired to incorporate the city's timeless wisdom into my own life, carrying the memories of its people, streets, and spirit with me forever. The experience had awakened a sense of curiosity, 
      compassion, and wonder within me, and I knew that I would carry Banaras in my heart, always.</p>
