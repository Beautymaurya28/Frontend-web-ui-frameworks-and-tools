<!-- Labels are used to highlight certain items, like categories or tags.

Badges are typically used to display a small piece of information, such as notifications or counts. -->
<!-- . Labels:
Labels are created using the .badge class with various color classes (bg-primary, bg-secondary, bg-success, etc.).

These labels are typically used to categorize or tag items (e.g., "Primary Label", "Danger Label", etc.).

2. Badges:
Badges are often used with buttons to display small pieces of information such as counts or notifications.

They are created by placing a span with the .badge class inside the button. The bg-* classes define the color of the badge (e.g., bg-secondary, bg-light, etc.).

The number inside the badge indicates a notification or count (e.g., 4 for "Notifications", 10 for "Messages").

3. Nested Badges:
You can also nest badges inside other badges. For example, the "New" badge has a nested "25" badge inside it, which might represent a count for new items.

How It Works:
Labels will display as small blocks with text and color, often used to represent different categories or statuses.

Badges will display as small notifications inside elements, like buttons, and can show numbers to represent counts or notifications. -->
